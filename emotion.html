	<h1><center><b>How to Control Your Emotions</center></b></h1>
	<h1><center><b>Take a look at the impact of your emotions</center></b></h1>
		<p style="color:orange"><i><big>Intense emotions aren’t all bad. It’s perfectly normal to experience some emotional overwhelm on occasion— when something wonderful happens, when something terrible happens, when you feel like you’ve missed out. Find some time to take stock of just how your uncontrolled emotions are affecting your day-to-day life. This will make it easier to identify problem areas (and track your success).</big></i></p>
		</br>
	<h1><center><b>Aim for regulation, not repression</center></b></h1>
		<p style="color:orange"><i><big>You can’t control your emotions with a dial (if only it were that easy!). But imagine, for a moment, that you could manage emotions this way.
You wouldn’t want to leave them running at maximum all the time. You also wouldn’t want to switch them off entirely, either.
When you suppress or repress emotions, you’re preventing yourself from experiencing and expressing feelings. This can happen consciously (suppression) or unconsciously (repression).</big></i></p>
		</br>
	<h1><center><b>Accept your emotions — all of them</center></b></h1>
		<p style="color:orange"><i><big>If you’re trying to get better at managing emotions, you might try downplaying your feelings to yourself. When you hyperventilate after receiving good news or collapse on the floor screaming and sobbing when you can’t find your keys, it might seem helpful to tell yourself, “Just calm down,” or “It’s not that big of a deal, so don’t freak out.” But this invalidates your experience. It is a big deal to you. Accepting emotions as they come helps you get more comfortable with them. Increasing your comfort around intense emotions allows you to fully feel them without reacting in extreme, unhelpful ways. Accepting emotions may lead toTrusted Source greater life satisfaction and fewer mental health symptoms. What’s more, people thinking of their emotions as helpful may lead toTrusted Source higher levels of happiness.</big></i></p>

	<h1><center><b> Give yourself some space</center></b></h1>
		<p style="color:orange"><i><big>Getting some distance from intense feelings can help you make sure you’re reacting to them in reasonable ways. This distance might be physical, like leaving an upsetting situation, for example. But you can also create some mental distance by distracting yourself. While you don’t want to block or avoid feelings entirely, it’s not harmful to distract yourself until you’re in a better place to deal with them. Just make sure you do come back to them. Healthy distractions are only temporary.</big></i></p>
		</br>
	<h1><center><b>Keep a mood journal</center></b></h1>
		<p style="color:orange"><i><big>Writing down (or typing up) your feelings and the responses they trigger can help you uncover any disruptive patterns. Sometimes, it’s enough to mentally trace emotions back through your thoughts. Putting feelings onto paper can allow you to reflect on them more deeply. It also helps you recognize when specific circumstances, like trouble at work or family conflict, contribute to harder-to-control emotions. Identifying specific triggers makes it possible to come up with ways to manage them more productively. Journaling provides the most benefit when you do it daily. Keep your journal with you and jot down intense emotions or feelings as they happen. Try to note the triggers and your reaction. If your reaction didn’t help, use your journal to explore more helpful possibilities for the future.</big></i></p>
