		<h1><center><b>Ways to sleep better</center></b></h1>
		<h1><center><b>Stick to a sleep schedule</center></b></h1>
			<p style="color:blue"><i><big>Set aside no more than eight hours for sleep. The recommended amount of sleep for a healthy adult is at least seven hours. Most people don't need more than eight hours in bed to achieve this goal.

Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Try to limit the difference in your sleep schedule on weeknights and weekends to no more than one hour. Being consistent reinforces your body's sleep-wake cycle.

If you don't fall asleep within about 20 minutes, leave your bedroom and do something relaxing. Read or listen to soothing music. Go back to bed when you're tired. Repeat as needed</big></i></p>
		</br>
		<h1><center><b>Pay attention to what you eat and drink</center></b></h1>
			<p style="color:orange"><i><big>Don't go to bed hungry or stuffed. In particular, avoid heavy or large meals within a couple of hours of bedtime. Your discomfort might keep you up.

Nicotine, caffeine and alcohol deserve caution, too. The stimulating effects of nicotine and caffeine take hours to wear off and can wreak havoc on quality sleep. And even though alcohol might make you feel sleepy, it can disrupt sleep later in the night.</big></i></p>
		</br>
		<h1><center><b>Limit day-time naps</center></b></h1>
			<p style="color:red"><i><big>Long daytime naps can interfere with nighttime sleep. If you choose to nap, limit yourself to up to 30 minutes and avoid doing so late in the day.

If you work nights, however, you might need to nap late in the day before work to help make up your sleep debt.</big></i></p>
		<h1><center><b>Include physical activities in your day-time routine</center></b></h1>
			<p style="color:red"><i><big>Regular physical activity can promote better sleep. Avoid being active too close to bedtime, however. Spending time outside every day might be helpful, too.</big></i></p>
